 ## Getting started
 
 ### Create
 We use the create command to create a new personnal page. You will be prompted for some questions about  yourself via the CLI 
 
  `page create <folder-name>`
  
  The page will be genrated and served immediately for preview before deploying to github pages
  
 ### Edit
 Use the edit command to edit existing page 
 
 `page edit`
 
 you will prompted for a series of question on the changes you would like to make 
 
 **NOTE:** you have to be inside the root folder your page
 
 ### Deploy
 This command deploys your page to github pages by default 
 
  `page deploy`
  
 you will prompted to enter your github username and password and a token would be generated for subsequent uses.
 
 **NOTE** we don't store your credentials 
 
 ### Serve 
 Use this command to serve and preview your page locally 
 
 `page serve`
 
 ### Reset conf
 Use this command to clear the CLI stored configurations. This might be useful when you encouter github signin errors which most times is as a result of deleted token 
 
 `page reset conf`
